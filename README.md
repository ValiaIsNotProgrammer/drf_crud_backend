CRUD Backend with Swagger Documentation

This project is an example of a CRUD backend for your web application. It also includes automatically generated Swagger documentation for your API. The project is deployed on the Vercel platform, and the following guide will help you get started.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
To begin, you need to clone this repository to your local computer. Use the following command to clone it:


```git clone https://github.com/your-repository-path.git```

## Step 2: Build the Project
The project is deployed on the Vercel platform, so you need to build it to prepare the application for deployment. Use these commands:

```npm install```

```npm run build```

Step 3: Edit and Import Environment Variables
For your application to work correctly on Vercel, you need to configure environment variables. An example configuration file, ```.env_example```, contains the necessary variables. Copy this file and rename it to .env. Then, edit it to add your values.

## Step 4: Deploy on Vercel
Now your project is ready for deployment. Use the Vercel platform to deploy your application by following these steps:

Visit Vercel and create an account if you don't have one.
Connect your Vercel account to your GitHub or GitLab repository.
Select your repository and configure deployment settings, specifying the path to your build and other configurations.
Click "Deploy," and your application will be deployed on Vercel.
Your CRUD backend with Swagger documentation is now accessible via the URL of your Vercel application. You can start using it and integrate it with your frontend.

This is a basic guide to get started with this project. Don't forget to read the Vercel platform documentation and customize your environment to suit your needs. Happy development!
